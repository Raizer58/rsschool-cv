3. My dream is to become a programmer since childhood. It’s a pity that I couldn’t get started earlier. I want to become a junior front-end developer and, after some time, more expensive to a senior front-end developer.
I mean the mathematical mindset and well-developed logic. I try to quickly learn everything new that is necessary for work. I like to constantly develop and achieve my goals.
