3. My dream is to become a programmer since childhood. It’s a pity that I couldn’t get started earlier. I want to become a junior front-end developer and, after some time, more expensive to a senior front-end developer.
I mean the mathematical mindset and well-developed logic. I try to quickly learn everything new that is necessary for work. I like to constantly develop and achieve my goals.
4. JavaScript - I understand the object, function, prototype, promise, class, closures, etc. Successfully cope with the tasks of codewars 4-6kyu. Familiar with the principles of OOP;
  HTML;
  CSS;
  GIT; 
  Photoshop.

 return line == String(line).split("").reverse().join("") ? true : false
} */

   // let removeChar = str => {return str.split("").splice(1).slice(0, -1).join("")} 

   /* function createMessage(...args) {
  return function(...arg2) {
    if(arg2[0]){
        return createMessage.apply(this, args.concat(...arg2));
    }
    return args.reduce((a, b) => {return a + " " + b})       
  }
}; */
